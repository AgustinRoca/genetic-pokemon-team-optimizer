# genetic-pokemon-team-optimizer

Sample code for Computational Thinking course hands-on project (2024 fall semester). The code has three main parts:

1. A genetic algorithm that optimizes a team of Pokemon for a given battle format. (`genetic.py`)
2. Some graphs that prove the genetic algorithm learning throughout the iterations (`visualizations.py`)
3. A 1v1 Pokemon battle simulator. (`1v1.py`)

## Disclaimer

This code was made as a proof of concept for a hands-on project in a course. It is not meant to be a full-fledged game.
The code is not optimized for performance, and it is not guaranteed to be bug-free.

## MacOS

MacOS has issues with `matplotlib` and `tkinter` right now. If you want to see the game board, you can run the game on a
different OS, or try to run it in a notebook.
